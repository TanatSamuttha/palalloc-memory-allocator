# pool-adaptive-linking memory-allocator (palalloc)

**Palalloc** is a pool-based memory allocator implemented in C. It organizes allocated memory into dynamically created **size classes** and uses an intrusive free-list to provide fast allocation and deallocation.

Instead of requiring a fixed set of size classes, Palalloc dynamically creates a new pool whenever a requested size is not currently supported. Existing larger size classes can also be split to satisfy smaller allocation requests.

## Implementation Details

* Memory is organized into separate pools for each supported allocation size.
* Each pool contains blocks of the same size.
* Free blocks are linked together using an intrusive singly linked list. The first bytes of each free block store a pointer to the next free block.
* Free blocks are returned in **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** order.
* Palalloc does not pre-create or pre-register size classes during initialization. Size classes are created dynamically when the first allocation of a particular size is requested.
* Each newly created pool contains at least 4096 bytes and normally allocates space for 16 blocks:

  ```cpp
  poolSize = max(4096, size * 16);
  ```
* When a new pool is created, all of its blocks are immediately linked into a free-list.
* Allocation has several possible paths:

  1. **Fast path:** If a free block exists in the requested size class, remove the head of the free-list and return it.
  2. **Split path:** If no free block exists in the requested size class, Palalloc searches larger size classes. If a larger free block is available, it is split into the requested size.
  3. **New-pool path:** If no suitable larger free block exists, Palalloc creates a new pool for the requested size.
  4. **New-size-class path:** If the requested size does not exist among the current size classes, a new size class is inserted and a new pool is created for it.
* Size classes are stored in ascending order.
* When a new size class is inserted, the existing size-class metadata is shifted to preserve ordering.
* The metadata arrays (`pools`, `heads`, and `sizeClasses`) grow dynamically when their capacity is exceeded.
* `pal_alloc()` itself does **not** fall back to `std::malloc` for an allocation request. It creates a new pool instead.
* The allocator does not store allocation metadata for individual pointers. Therefore, `pal_free()` requires the allocation size to identify the corresponding size class.

### Free-list splitting

When a requested size class has no available blocks, `pal_split()` iteratively searches for a larger size class by doubling the requested size on each iteration.

For example, if the requested size is 256 bytes and a free 1024-byte block is available:

```text
1024-byte block
      ↓
split
      ↓
256 + 256 + 256 + 256
```

The larger block is divided directly into multiple blocks of the requested size. The first block is returned to the caller, while the remaining blocks are linked together and assigned as the new free-list of the requested size class.

This allows unused blocks from larger size classes to be reused for smaller allocations without recursively splitting through intermediate size classes.

## Initialization

Create a `Palalloc` object using `pal_create()` and initialize it with `pal_init()`:

```cpp
Palalloc pool = pal_create();

pal_init(&pool);
```

`pal_init()` allocates the metadata arrays but does not allocate the actual memory pool yet.

Memory pools are allocated on demand when `pal_alloc()` is called.

## Allocation

Allocate memory using:

```cpp
void* ptr = pal_alloc(&pool, 256);
```

If the requested size class already exists and has a free block, the head of its free-list is returned.

If no free block is available, Palalloc attempts to split a larger size class. If splitting is not possible, a new pool is allocated for the requested size.

The returned memory is aligned according to the alignment provided by `malloc()` for the underlying pool allocation. However, Palalloc does not explicitly enforce alignment for individual block sizes.

## Deallocation

Free memory using:

```cpp
pal_free(&pool, ptr, 256);
```

The allocation size **must match the size class used when the block was allocated**.

The block is inserted at the head of the corresponding free-list:

```text
Before:

HEAD → A → B → C

free(D)

After:

HEAD → D → A → B → C
```

This provides LIFO reuse, causing recently freed memory to be reused first.

Passing an invalid pointer, an already freed pointer, or an incorrect size results in undefined behavior.

## Dynamic Size Classes

Unlike allocators with a predefined set of size classes, Palalloc creates size classes dynamically.

For example:

```cpp
pal_alloc(&pool, 256);
pal_alloc(&pool, 512);
pal_alloc(&pool, 1024);
```

creates three size classes:

```text
256
512
1024
```

If a new size is requested:

```cpp
pal_alloc(&pool, 300);
```

a new size class is inserted:

```text
256
300
512
1024
```

A new pool is then created specifically for 300-byte blocks.

Therefore, Palalloc does **not** round unsupported allocation sizes to the nearest predefined size class.

## Pool Management

Each size class owns one pool:

```text
Size class 256
└── Pool
    └── Free list

Size class 512
└── Pool
    └── Free list

Size class 1024
└── Pool
    └── Free list
```

The allocator stores three pieces of metadata for every size class:

| Metadata         | Description                              |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `pools[i]`       | Beginning address of the memory pool     |
| `heads[i]`       | Head of the free-list                    |
| `sizeClasses[i]` | Block size represented by the size class |

## Dynamic Metadata Capacity

The metadata arrays are dynamically resized when a new size class exceeds the current capacity.

The initial capacity is:

```text
1 size class
```

When more capacity is required, the capacity is increased to the larger of:

```text
current size
current capacity × 2
```

This applies to:

* `pools`
* `heads`
* `sizeClasses`

## Destroying the Allocator

Call:

```cpp
pal_destroy(&pool);
```

to release all memory pools and metadata.

`pal_destroy()`:

1. Frees every memory pool.
2. Frees the size-class metadata.
3. Frees the free-list head metadata.
4. Resets `mSize` and `mCap`.
5. Marks the allocator as uninitialized.

After calling `pal_destroy()`, all previously allocated pointers become dangling pointers.

## Utility Functions

The implementation also contains several internal utility functions:

### `pal_clz`

Returns the number of leading zero bits in a 32-bit integer.

It uses:

* `_BitScanReverse` when compiled with MSVC.
* `__builtin_clz` on other compilers.

For zero, it returns `32`.

### `pal_max`

Returns the larger of two `uint32_t` values.

### `pal_nextPow2`

Returns the next power of two greater than or equal to the input.

### `pal_findIdx`
(Internal use only)

Searches the size-class array starting from a specified index and returns the index of the requested size class.

### `pal_ensureCap`
(Internal use only)

Expands the metadata arrays when the number of size classes exceeds the current capacity.

### `pal_newPool`
(Internal use only)

Creates a new memory pool for a size class and links all blocks into its free-list.

### `pal_split`
(Internal use only)

Searches larger size classes and recursively splits a larger free block into blocks belonging to a smaller size class.

## Important Limitations

* `pal_free()` requires the caller to provide the allocation size.
* The allocator does not track whether a pointer has already been freed.
* Invalid pointers and incorrect sizes result in undefined behavior.
* `pal_alloc()` does not have a `malloc()` fallback. If memory allocation performed by the underlying `malloc()` fails, the behavior follows the normal `malloc()` failure semantics and the current implementation does not explicitly handle the failure.
* There is no built-in tracking of allocations that are currently in use.
* The allocator is **not thread-safe**. Each `Palalloc` instance should be accessed by only one thread at a time unless external synchronization is provided.
* Pools are allocated using `std::malloc`/`malloc`, so the allocator itself depends on the system allocator for obtaining new pools.
* The allocator is designed around exact requested sizes rather than a fixed predefined size-class table.
* The allocator can not allocate data smaller than 8 bytes (size of pointer). It will automatically round to 8 bytes.
* Pool memory is not returned to the system when individual blocks are freed. It is released only when `pal_destroy()` is called.

## Example

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include "palalloc.h"

int main()
{
    Palalloc pool = pal_create();

    pal_init(&pool);

    int* a = (int*)pal_alloc(&pool, sizeof(int));
    int* b = (int*)pal_alloc(&pool, sizeof(int));

    *a = 10;
    *b = 20;

    printf("%d %d\n", *a, *b);

    pal_free(&pool, a, sizeof(int));
    pal_free(&pool, b, sizeof(int));

    pal_destroy(&pool);

    return 0;
}
```

## Design Philosophy

Palalloc prioritizes **simple metadata, fast free-list operations, and reuse of recently freed memory** over the general-purpose flexibility of `std::malloc`.

The core design is based on three ideas:

```text
Dynamic Size Classes
        +
Intrusive LIFO Free Lists
        +
Adaptive Block Splitting
        =
Palalloc
```

This makes Palalloc particularly suitable for workloads where allocation sizes are relatively predictable and where fast allocation/deallocation is more important than supporting arbitrary general-purpose allocation patterns.
